**Filter the Spire** lets you customize your Slay the Spire seeds before you start a game. The mod works as a vanilla friendly seed searching tool to help you customize which seeds you'll encounter in your runs. The main benefit to using this mod is that it actually searches for the seeds it tries to find! It doesn't just forcibly tweak a given seed to have your desired parameters, meaning you'll be able to share this seed with anyone else who wishes to play it!

This mod only has a single filter at the moment - customizable Boss Swaps - but more filters are planned for future releases when I ever can find spare time to work on it again.

Using this mod lets you choose to only have seeds where your Neow boss swap bonus is something like a guaranteed *Pandora's Box* or *Runic Pyramid* or perhaps only energy relics - or any other fun swaps you can think of!
