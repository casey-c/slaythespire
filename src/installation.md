# Installing My Mods

---

**These instructions are for Github releases only**

If you see a Steam Workshop link - use that instead! It will simplifiy the process greatly and you won't have to manually download and update my mods.

If I haven't yet released a Workshop link, it's likely that I didn't feel the mod to be polished / ready enough for a full release (e.g. having issues like not scaling nicely for non 1080p displays, performance hiccups or crashes, or otherwise buggy or incomplete behavior). So if you're following these instructions, it's probably for one of my more experimental / in development mods. I still accept bug reports for these mods, but there's a lot of projects that are abandoned due to time constraints that I may never get to them. 

With that disclaimer out of the way, here's how to install Slay the Spire mods:

## Quick Instructions

1. Make sure to obtain and enable [ModTheSpire](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605060445) and [BaseMod](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605833019).

2. Download the latest 
```.JAR``` 
file from the releases page of the mod.

3. Place the 
```(modname).JAR```
into your 
```SlayTheSpire/mods```
folder
4. Launch the game with mods, and be sure to enable ✓ both BaseMod and my mod(s).

## Detailed Instructions (if the above instructions didn't make sense)



1. Download [ModTheSpire](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605060445) and [BaseMod](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605833019). These mods are available from the Steam Workshop and are are *REQUIRED* libraries that my mods use to function correctly. If you don't have them installed and enabled, your game will not even load, so get them!

You should *subscribe* to them on Steam and it will automatically download and keep them updated for you.

*NOTE: If you don't have access to the Steam Workshop (e.g. from a non-steam copy of the game), there are ways to download those files anyway. Search for "steam workshop downloader" on your friendly, neighborhood search engine - although the rest is up to you to figure out.*

2. Download the latest version of one of my mods. You can find it on the Github releases page for the particular mod. 

*Ex: for **InfoMod**, the main page is [https://github.com/casey-c/infomod2](https://github.com/casey-c/infomod2) and then the releases page is [https://github.com/casey-c/infomod2/releases](https://github.com/casey-c/infomod2/releases). You'll need to download the latest .JAR file from the releases page (```InfoMod2.jar```) to get what you need to run my mod.*

3. Place the downloaded .JAR file (as is, don't extract it or anything) directly into your ```SlayTheSpire/mods``` folder. This folder is operating system dependent and may have to be created if it doesn't exist. The main game executable is located on Windows somewhere like: 

```C:/Program Files (x76)/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire/```  

From there, you'll either need to create a ```mods``` subfolder or place the .JAR file directly into the one that already exists. For our **InfoMod** example, after we put it into the correct place, the full path on Windows will look something like:

```C:/Program Files (x76)/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire/mods/InfoMod2.jar```  

4. Launch the game with mods. On Steam, you'll need to specifically choose "Play with Mods" when you launch the game. You'll get the ModTheSpire popup window which includes a list of all mods you've subscribed to or downloaded. Make sure to check ✓ the boxes next to BaseMod and my mods to enable them to start. Click the Play Game button to launch into Slay the Spire from there!

If you have any issues getting mods to install, try Googling your problem - there's also a [SlayTheSpire subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/slaythespire/) and an [official Discord](https://discord.gg/SlayTheSpire) if you get stuck from there. Good luck and happy modding!
