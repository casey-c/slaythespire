# List of Mods

Here's a collection of some of my more polished mods. Most of these have been uploaded to the Steam Workshop or have workshop releases planned for the near future.

* [Bestiary](./bestiary.md) - An overlay for each monster displaying their movesets and abilities
* [DarkMap](./darkmap.md) - Gives the map a dark theme for late night spire slayin'
* [Filter the Spire](./filterthespire.md) - Filter out Slay the Spire seeds for fun boss swap shenanigans
* [InfoMod](./infomod.md) - A comprehensive UI enhancement mod to give quick access to helpful information
