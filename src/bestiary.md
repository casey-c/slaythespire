Originally part of InfoMod but forked off into its own standalone mod, **Bestiary** is designed to present enemy abilities and movesets in a straightfoward and aesthetically pleasing overlay. The mod allows players to Shift+Right+Click an enemy in combat and pull up a convienient window displaying their patterns of attack, damage values, and probability distributions for their intents.

Designed for all levels of play, **Bestiary** supports every ascension level and monster in the base game, and hides completely out of the way when unneeded. It is one of the few mods I've created that is also designed to be controller friendly -- letting players who don't like using mouse and keyboard get access to the information as well.
