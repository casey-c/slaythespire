**InfoMod** provides a clean, intuitive interface for displaying all the hidden or otherwise tedious to calculate information not shown by the base game. It is a UI enhancement mod that replaces unneccessary tool tips with beautiful, functional displays.

From tracking potion drop chance, to question floor probabilities, to card drop chances and more - **InfoMod** gives players quick access to the information required to make high level choices, without needing to pull out a calculator!

None of the information within **InfoMod** is unavailable without the mod - it doesn't provide cheaty insights into a run that you wouldn't be able to determine without it. It simply exists as a convienient and accessible extension to the base game interface to supply that information when needed.

**InfoMod**'s tool tip oriented design lets it stay uncluttered and out of the way when unneeded, providing a near vanilla experience but with the option to explore the maths in greater detail when desired.
